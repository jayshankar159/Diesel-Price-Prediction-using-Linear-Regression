# Diesel-Price-Prediction-using-Linear-Regression
This project focuses on predicting diesel prices using Linear Regression, a fundamental supervised machine learning algorithm.

The model is trained on historical diesel price data and attempts to find the best-fitting line that represents the relationship between time (or other features) and diesel price.

The goal of this project is to:

Understand fuel price trends.

Build a regression model for prediction.

Demonstrate end-to-end implementation of data preprocessing, visualization, model training, evaluation, and prediction.
